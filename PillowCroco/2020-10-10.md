```python
# 시간 단위는 분
if 도착시간 > 시작시간 :
    벌금 += math.ceiling((도착시간-시작시간) / 5) * 500

# 'problems' is a list of problems
# 'hosts' is a list of all host who participate in the group study.
# each 'problem' has a 'host' who picks it.

for p in problems:
    for h in hosts:
        if not p.accepted and not p.explained :
            h.벌금 += 2000

        if not p.accepted and p.host is h:
            h.벌금 += 2000
